# Tech Challenge

### Build & Run
To start the application, navigate to the project directory and run `./gradlew bootRun`, or use your favourite IDE to start the application.
The root of the API is at `localhost:8080/api`.

I have added a test endpoint to easily setup some test data. You will find it at `/test/setup`.
